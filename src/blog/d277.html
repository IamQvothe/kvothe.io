            <br>
            <h1 class=" text-lg font-medium">Hey all, todays writeup is for D277 or Front-End Web Development</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="tk-text">There are two tasks for this class.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="tk-text"><strong>Task 1.</strong> You will design a “wireframe” of how your website will be designed. This can be very simple or advanced. I recommend NOT doing this task first and while this is only my opinion I think it is a fair one. When you submit task 1 you will be held to that design and if any of you are creators being held to strict design standards is grueling when you are supposed to be creative. Here is what I did. </p>
            <br>
            <ol class="pl-8">
                <li class="list-decimal">Skip task 1 entirely and immediately start working on task 2</li>
                <br>
                <li class="list-decimal ">Once you have completed task 2 go back to task 1 and create your wireframe from the design of your website from task 2. This ensures 1. Your creative workflow wasn’t disrupted and 2. You are guaranteed to pass task 1 as long as you meet the minimum requirements for the task.</li>
                <br>
            </ol>
            <p class="tk-text"> <strong>Task 2.</strong> I used this as an opportunity to learn a CSS framework like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" class="hover:text-white underline">TailwindCSS</a>. TailwindCSS is an amazing utility based framework that allows you to do all of your styling with custom predefined classes inside of your HTML elements. This was a horrible mistake and I will explain why.
                <br>
                <br>
                I learned so much about basic web development from this project. I learned how to use TailwindCSS and I used those skills to build the website your viewing currently and while still very basic, I am very proud of it. Here is why it was an arguable mistake.
                <br>
                <br>
                The evaluators DO NOT understand TailwindCSS, I had submitted my project several times and even had to get in contact with my course instructor. Come to find out, many other course instructors have advised against using a CSS framework but at this point I refused to rewrite and undo all my hard work.
                <br>
                <br>
                Tip for evaluation I became privy to (an evaluator sent me a screen shot confirming this.) when they evaluate your files locally all they do is open each individual file and check for the minimum requirements. This posed an issue for me because for some reason doing this my CSS would never display properly to them but when I ran it in a local server (I was not using tailwinds CDN at the time) it ran perfectly. This could be a my issue, tailwind issue, or evaluator issue. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Alright, enough of that here are the steps I believe you should take to <strong> succeed </strong>in this course.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol class="pl-8">
                <li class="list-decimal">DO NOT (unless you are a masochist) use a CSS framework for this class. Use basic CSS and meet the minimum requirements. If you are looking for an opportunity to improve your web dev skills this is NOT it. Take your project after it is accepted and make it better on your own time. You need to do this either way to build up these skills.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="list-decimal">Pay close attention to the rubric. The HTML elements in part A need to be on all your pages but part B only need to be included once. </li>
                <br>
                <li class="list-decimal">Again pay attention to the rubric for part C these elements only need to be included once for the minimum requirements.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="list-decimal">Consult <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank" class="hover:text-white underline">W3Schools</a> if you forgot how to make a form. Talk to ChatGPT to walk you through creating the JS code to verify matching username fields (Don’t just copy what chatgpt gives you, learn it, understand it, retain it.)</li>
                <br>
                <li class="list-decimal">Lastly its time to host our website and this is not as bad as other students make it out to be. I used Freehostingnoads.net. All of these sites are sketchy, and want lots of your information. Don’t give them a single thing except your school email because you will need to receive a confirmation email. Drag and drop all your files in your project directory and then go into each webpage and verify the paths are still correct and that everything is displaying properly.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p class="tk-text">Another quirk I experienced in this class was due to hosting. I would upload all my files and verify that my site was functioning properly but I would get my project sent back because the evaluator would state some parts of my site are broken. I found this not to be true as I tested site from many different devices (I am getting beyond frustrated at this point.) and IPs and determined my site WAS functioning and the errors was on the evaluators end. Don’t bother telling anyone that it won’t do you any good.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the end I finished, save yourself some headache and only do what is required for this class and then take that project after you finish the course and take some time to build your web dev skills. I have completed 12 classes this term and this class gave me the biggest headache.

            <p class="font-semibold">If WGU staff comes across this post by chance, please take the following into consideration as I feel it would improve the student experience for this course.</p>
            <ol class="pl-8 tk-text">
                <li class="list-disc">Please ensure evaluators are familiar with CSS frameworks, I am not a student that wants to do the bare minimum I want to go above and beyond but if I am repeatedly punished for this rather purposely or not. I will do the minimum.</li>
                <li class="list-disc">Please allow hosting on Github pages. It works flawlessly, its free, and it is safe. The provided hosting platforms are incredibly sketchy and want a lot of personal information. </li>
